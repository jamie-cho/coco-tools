# basictobasic09

This utility converts Microsoft Color BASIC programs into Microware BASIC09
Programs that work on OS-9 Level 2. This conversion process has many benefits:
1. Makes the wealth of Color BASIC programs available to OS-9.
2. Makes the program run a lot faster in most cases.
3. Provides a gentle slope to learning BASIC09 as this language has many of
   its own quirks that can be hard to learn when coming from Color BASIC.

The utility provides a best effort for conversion which means:
* We make a reasonable effort to maintain the intended semantics of the source
  program.
* For valid programs, results will vary because it will use BASIC09's and
  OS-9's built in functionality such as floating point, random and drawing
  routines. This may introduce unintended differences in program behavior.
* It will flag a subset of known issues such as syntax errors or disallowed
  syntax.
* It will result in conversion to some BASIC09 programs that are not valid and
  will get flagged when loaded by BASIC09.
* Color BASIC has some not very well defined lexing and parsing behavior. We
  disallow these constructs because they lead to behavior that is not very
  clear.
* We currently only support VDG screens.

## Supported constructs
Most Color BASIC and some Extended Color BASIC and Super Extended Color BASIC
features are supported. These include:
include: ABS, +, AND, ASC, ATN, BUTTON, CHR$, CLS, COS, DATA, DIM, /,
END, ELSE, =, EXP, FOR, GOTO, GOSUB, >, IF, INKEY$, INPUT, INT, JOYSTK, LEFT$,
LEN, <, LET, LOG, MID$, *, NEXT, NOT, OPEN, OR, PRINT, READ, REM, RESET,
RESTORE, RETURN, RIGHT$, RND, SET, SGN, SIN, SOUND, SQR, STEP, STOP, STR$, -,
TAB, TAN, THEN, TO, VAL

## Supported constructs that need some explanation
* Hexadecimal literals of the form 0xABCDEF are supported. For values less
  than 0x8000, the values are converted to integers of the form $ABCD. For
  values greater than that, they are converted to REAL literals with the
  equivalent value.
* VAL is a direct port that uses BASIC09's implementation of VAL. This means
  that when parsing HEX numbers they should look like "$1234" instead of
  "&H1234".
* By default variables are not DIMensioned and assumed to be STRING or REAL.
  They are initialized to "" or 0 at the beginning of the output program.
* Numeric literal expressions are assumed to be INTEGERs unless that have
  a decimal point or exponent or cannot be represented by an INTEGER. So
  PRINT 3 / 2 will print 1.5 in Color BASIC but the converted BASIC09 program
  will print 1.
* `CLEAR N` is mapped to `(* CLEAR N *)` but `CLEAR  N, M` is disallowed.
* `CLS` requires that we map the VDG screen for any value that is <> `1`.
  The same is true for `POINT`, `RESET` and `SET`. Note that this can easily
  result in unexpected memory errors while running the program. Running it
  with less space allocated may resolve the issue.
* `NOT (A) + 1` is parsed correctly as `NOT((A) + 1)` or `LNOT((A) + 1)`
* BASIC09 treats boolean operations differently than Color BASIC which
  largely treats them identically to numeric binary operations.
  Specifically, BASIC09 has keywords for boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT)
  that are distinct from the numeric operations (LAND, LOR, LNOT).
  basictobasic09 will use the former in IF statements and the latter for other
  statements. There are some constructs that mix boolean and numeric
  operations such as `A = (1 < 2) + 1` that basitobasic09 allows but
  results in BASIC09 programs with errors.
* Converting numeric values into a string formats the number with NO spaces
  and one decimal point, even if the value is an integer.
* `NEXT AA, BB` is translated to
```
  NEXT AA
NEXT BB
```
* Some constructs require introducing an intermediary variable including
  BUTTON, INKEY, JOYSTK and POINT.
10 IF (INKEY$()="") THEN 10 is converted into a construct that looks like:
```
10 RUN INKEY$(TMP1): IF TMP1 = "" THEN 10
```

## Unsupported Color BASIC constructs
* These constructs are NOT supported by basictobasic09:
AUDIO, CLEAR, CLOAD, CONT, CSAVE, EOF, EVAL, EXEC, LIST, LLIST, LOAD, MEM,
MOTOR, NEW, PEEK, POKE, RUN, SKIPF, USR
* It is NOT possible to GOTO, GOSUB, ON GOTO or ON GOSUB to a variable.
* NEXT statements MUST have the iteration variable specified.
* NEXT statements must be nested and not interleaved. For example, this is legal:
```
FOR II = 1 to 10
  FOR JJ = 1 to 10
  NEXT JJ
NEXT II
```
But this is illegal:
```
FOR II = 1 to 10
  FOR JJ = 1 to 10
  NEXT II
NEXT JJ
```

## Weird, unsupported Color BASIC constructs
* Numeric literals must NOT have whitespace. For example, this is illegal: `12 34`
* `10 PRINT AA SIN(1)` and constructs like this are NOT allowed.
